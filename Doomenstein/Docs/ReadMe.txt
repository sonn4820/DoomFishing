Gameplay Story:

You, a renowned warrior known as the Doom guy, found yourself in an unexpected situation. Your spacecraft was hit, forcing you to make an emergency landing on the Moon. To your surprise, you discovered that the Moon had rivers teeming with fish. This revelation reignited a long-forgotten childhood dream of yours â€“ to become a fisherman. Tired of the constant battles you've endured, you saw this as an opportunity to finally lay down your arms and embrace a more peaceful existence.
However, your respite was short-lived. Monstrous beings soon emerged, intent on plundering your hard-earned catch. Your warrior instincts kicked in, and you realized that you had no choice but to defend your newfound livelihood from these menacing creatures. Despite your initial desire for tranquility, you found yourself once again in the familiar position of having to eliminate every last one of these invading monsters.
